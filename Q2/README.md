1. Done install
2. -check that c is the product of a & b

   -Perp power of Tau ceremony allow multiple participants to perform a trusted setup sequentially, and adding their results to a public transcript. One participant destroys toxic waste is good enough.

   The second MPC is not strictly necessary but makes the last participant unable to decide in any property of the final key.

   -Phase 1 continues in perpetuity, while any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1 to start their specific phase 2 ceremony

   MMORPG, a central “coordinator” manages messages between the participants. The CRS is generated in two phases. The first phase referred to as “Powers of Tau”, produces generic setup parameters that can be used for all circuits of the scheme, up to a given size. The second phase converts the output of the Powers of Tau phase into an NP-relation-specific CRS.
